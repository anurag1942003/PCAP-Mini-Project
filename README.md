## Optimizing Edge Detection: A Comparative Study of Sobel Algorithm Performance Across CPU, GPU, and Hybrid Computing Environments(MPI-CUDA)

This project aims to evaluate and compare the performance of the Sobel edge detection algorithm across different computing environments, including CPU, GPU with CUDA, and a hybrid approach combining CUDA with Message Passing Interface (MPI). The objective is to identify the most efficient computing strategy for executing the Sobel edge detection algorithm, particularly for large-scale image processing tasks.

### Project Overview
The Sobel edge detection algorithm is a fundamental technique used in image processing to highlight edges within images. This project explores the algorithm's implementation and performance across various computing environments to optimize processing time and efficiency, crucial for applications requiring real-time processing or handling of large datasets.
